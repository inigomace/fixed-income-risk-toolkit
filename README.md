# Fixed Income Risk Toolkit (NSS Yield Curve, DV01 & VaR)

A small fixed-income risk engine built in Python and Jupyter that aims to:

- Calibrate **Nelson–Siegel–Svensson (NSS)** yield curves
- Price fixed-coupon government bonds and portfolios
- Compute **key-rate DV01 / PVBP** by tenor bucket
- Run **parallel / steepener / flattener** curve stress scenarios
- Estimate **historical** and **Monte Carlo VaR**
- Maintain a **clean, reproducible Git/Python/Jupyter pipeline** with tests and method notes

Designed as a learning project and portfolio piece for rates / risk / quant internship applications.

## 1. Current Status

The project is being built in stages.  
The foundation implemented so far includes:

- Yield history ingestion
- Strict validation rules
- Unit standardization (percent vs decimal)
- Tenor scope currently set to:

  **3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y**

This smaller tenor set is intentional to preserve consistent historical coverage.

## 2. Features (Planned / In Progress)

- **Yield Curve Modeling**
  - Nelson–Siegel–Svensson (NSS) parametric curve
  - Single-date and time-series calibration
  - Fit diagnostics and parameter history

- **Instrument & Portfolio Layer**
  - Fixed-coupon bullet bonds (e.g. Treasuries)
  - Cashflow generation and discounting from the fitted curve
  - Simple portfolio abstraction with PV breakdown

- **Risk Sensitivities**
  - Parallel DV01 / PVBP
  - **Key-rate DV01** using bump-and-reprice
  - Clear bump-size and convention documentation

- **Curve Stress Testing**
  - Configurable **parallel** shifts
  - **Steepener** and **flattener** scenarios
  - Portfolio P&L impact reporting

- **Value at Risk (VaR)**
  - **Historical VaR** from realized yield changes
  - **Monte Carlo VaR** using simulated shocks

- **Engineering Hygiene**
  - `src/` package layout
  - Unit tests with `pytest`
  - Clean imports and reproducible execution

## 3. Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python (3.10+ recommended)
- **Core libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`
- **Dev tooling (planned):** `pytest`, `black`, `ruff`, `pre-commit`

## 4. Project Structure (Current)

The current layout keeps early-stage utilities, test scripts, and the sample dataset
inside the package for simplicity while bootstrapping the pipeline.
